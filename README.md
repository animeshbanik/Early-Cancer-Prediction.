In contemporary healthcare, early cancer detection is of paramount importance. Identifying cancerous conditions at an early stage significantly improves patient outcomes and enables more effective treatment strategies. This project aims to leverage the potential of machine learning 

Objective:
Develop and fine-tune machine learning models for the early detection of oral, cervical, and brain tumors.
Utilize comprehensive datasets, comprising both image and risk factor data, to train and validate the predictive models.
Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
Establish a foundation for the seamless integration of predictive models into clinical practice, enhancing diagnostic capabilities in cancer detection.
